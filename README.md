# FarmGame
This is my first C++ console game (I have no idea how Github's readme formatting works)

## It is simple and offers some basic features such as:

  ### -Animals that produce products after certain days
  
  ### -You can sell those products on the market
  
  ### -The market changes on a daily and weekly basis. 
  
  ### ---The market prices vary daily around a base price, with a bit of a random number with inflation (for the funs).
   
  ### ---The market base prices vary weekly on a random number with inflation (for the funs)

  ### -Simple Save/Load system. Literally just outputs the data to a file and reads from them
  
  ### - Random events. Any of the following events may occur at any day:
  
  -- Robbery

  -- Wolf Attack

  -- Hyperinflation (for a day)

  -- Plague (for a day)

  -- Villager Requests

  -- Animal Capture

  -- Market crash

  -- Tornado
