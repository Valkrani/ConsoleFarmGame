# FarmGame
This is my first C++ console game
It is simple and offers some basic features such as:
  -Animals that produce products after certain days
  -You can sell those products on the market
  -The market changes on a daily and weekly basis
    -The market prices vary daily around a base price, with a bit of a random number with inflation (for the funs)
    -The market base prices vary weekly on a random number with inflation (for the funs)
  -Simple Save/Load system. Literally just outputs the data to a file and reads from them
  -Soon to add random events that can change the boring gameplay
